          <h1>Non Garbage Games Manifesto</h1>


          <p>We at NGG are tired of games that do not live up to their artistic and entertainment potential.
          Often due to incorrect priorities on the part of the development team, or outside forces not understanding what a good game is.

          We are tired of commmerical campaigns that knowingly focus on aspects of gameplay
             that ultimately are not part of the finalized product.

          We are tired of game studios not taking their audience seriously.</p>
          <p>We at NGG therefore declare that we will uncompromisingly produce games that line up with our Game Design Philosophy.
            And we vow to treat our audience with respect and value their time and interest.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>Game Design Philosophy</h2>
          <p>Our game philosophy prioritizes the following aspects of game design:</p>

          <ul>
              <li>
                  <p>Core Gameplay. The core gameplay, the thing you actually do eighty percent of the time in a game, has to be fun, varied and interesting enough to justify taking such a bulk of the overall game experience. The gameplay must never feel like a “grind”.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <p>Story. The story in the game has to add to the games artistic value, and not feel like something tacked on to bridge levels thematically. We do not make games for children, we believe our audience desires complex storylines with a certain level of writing competence, and we intend to deliver.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <p>Player choice. The player must feel like an active agent in the game experience, not like someone being led down a path of gameplay moments. Video Games are at their best when they are interactive narrative experiences, and can actively use the interactivity as no other medium can.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <p>Replayability. Good games are games that are worth playing more than once. We want to focus on replayability in our games to make them more interesting and richer experiences.</p>
              </li>
          </ul>
