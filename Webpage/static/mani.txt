We at NGG are tired of games that do not live up to their artistic and entertainment potential. Often due to incorrect priorities on the part of the development team, or outside forces not understanding what a good game is. We are tired of commmerical campaigns that knowingly focus on aspects of gameplay that ultimately are not part of the finalized product. We are tired of game studios not taking their audience seriously.

We at NGG therefore declare that we will uncompromisingly produce games that line up with our Game Design Philosophy. And we vow to treat our audience with respect and value their time and interest.
