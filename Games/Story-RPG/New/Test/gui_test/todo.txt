Flag system.

Rules:

* Flags are all in tags.

Tags come in the following types:

* greeting
* greeting_reply
* question
* answer
* flag_<id>
* card_<id>

Card nodes will also contain the following tags:

 * name_<npc name>
     These are the names of the people that can be asked about this card.
     Those people need Question tags with the card Flag on them.

Flags come in the following types:

 * flag_start_<npc name>
     This is the first greeting of an NPC, the default one.
     This is a unique flag, as it defaults to True.
 * flag_<id>
     These are regular flags.
     If they are found in a question, they block that question from being asked,
      unless this flag is tagged to true.
    If they are found in an answer, they set this flag to true.
