Flag system.

Rules:

* Flags are all in tags.

Tags come in the following types:

* greeting
* greeting_reply
* question
* answer
* flag_<id>
* card_<id>

Card nodes will also contain the following tags:

 * name_<npc name>

Flags come in the following types:

 * flag_start_<npc name>
     This is the first greeting of an NPC, the default one.
     This is a unique flag, as it defaults to True.
 * flag_<id>
     This are regular flags.
     If they are found in a question, they block that question from being asked,
      unless this flag is tagged to true.
    If they are found in an answer, they set this flag to true.
