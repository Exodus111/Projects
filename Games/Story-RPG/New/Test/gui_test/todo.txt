Todo list for the Card system  of the Story Game.

- Cards (Person/Event).

Cards should have several text areas and one image areas.

--The Image are of the card.
    The image area of the card should
    be on the top left side.
    -Person cards should have the image
     of the person the card is about.
    -Event cards should have a general image
     about the TYPE of event.
     -Even Types:
        * The War
        * Village Shenanigans
        * Relevant History

--The Text Areas.
    -Title
     The title of the card must be at the top of the card.
     centered, but on the right side.
     Title of the card must be unique.
    -Main Text area.
     The main text area is in the middle of the
     card, but right of the image.
     This area needs to be able to scroll.
    -Tags area.
     Tags go at the bottom of the card, centered.
     Tags are the name of the NPC the player can
     ask about this card.

     Once every NPC possible has been asked about a card,
     that card is retired, and placed in the retired cards section.

 - Card Inventory.

 The Card Inventory page should be a
  grid displaying cards based on time acquired,
  placing the newer cards at the top.
  It should also be possible to display the cards
  based on other criteria, like type or person.

 The Inventory also needs to paginate sideways,
  once there are too many cards for one page.

 There also needs to be a retired cards section.

 - New Card message.

 We need a message area, that will display to
  the player when he has acquired a new card.
