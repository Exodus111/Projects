The player is free to imagine for himself any background he likes, as this is the character the player will be playing, and the player is required to choose a personality trait (like a class) that essentially alters his personality somewhat, it is left to the players to invent their own background. \n\nFor all intents and purposes our young scribe is a blank slate, and only there to be a vessel for the players. He does however speak directly to the players during the intro portion of the game, breaking the fourth wall. He might do so again for game mechanic purposes. Otherwise he is a silent protagonist.\n",

        "Node13": "Ooh! An important assignement, sounds important... literally.",

        "Node2": "The old preacher, Djonsiscus. \n\nThis man has been with the village for many years, and serves as both our players mentor and our player character mentor. \n\nIn a sense, or at least initially, he is not a part of the rest of the game. He is basically the quest giver that instructs our player on what to do. He has general information that the player can seek out, but is largely bound by his vow of secrecy, a trait taken from the Catholic priests during confessionals. \n\nThat works the same in this world (it\u2019s a very common mechanic among priesthoods,  as it satisfies the need in a society both for therapeutic services, and also helps the priest become an integral member of said society. A person that knows everyone\u2019s secrets is a person everyone wants on their good side). So essentially this guy might know a whole lot more than he is allowed to let on, and while he will come off as simply a typical quest giver at first, there might be more to his motivations as the player will discover later on. But at least initially, this old Preacher is not on the suspect list.",

I have forbidden anyone from leaving, in case the murderer wants to escape, and it's too long to wait for anyone else to arrive.\n\nYou Thack, are the only impartial member of the Village, you only arrived recently, and you have spent most of your time locked in your study.\n\nI don't think you even know the people left. That makes you ideally suited to gather information, and investigate what is going on. ",

The player will never interact with this one, he is a mutilated corpse, torn to shreds in multiple pieces lying all across his study. The player will want to learn all they can about him, from the other people in the village, uncovering his murder is the purpose of the game.\n",
        "Node4": "Jarold, The Blacksmith. \n\nA Middle aged man. \nThis NPC is one of the two most talkative NPCs the player will interact with, and can supply ample information about the other characters. He has his own Smithy and tends to work on it at all hours of the night.",
        "Node5": "The Fishmongers Wife, Tylda Travisteene. \nMiddleaged Woman. \n\nThe Fishmonger died years ago, she runs the shop. The second very talkative NPC, no one gossips like a Fishmonger's wife. One of the few NPCs that will not be found alone in the initial portion of the game as she lives and works with her Daughter.",
