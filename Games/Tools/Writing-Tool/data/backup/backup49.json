No names or anything like that.\n\nJust amounts. Quantity of Orcs. And different types. \n20 archers, 40 soldiers with wodden clubs. That kind of thing.\n\nIt was very important for them to fulfill the quotas on their lists.\n\nI never knew why, but from what I could gather, every nobleman had some version of these lists, they would talk among themselves about it on many occasions.",

        "Node4894": "Oh. Heavens no!\n\nThat is not what I meant. Travisteen, he was, well he was my best friend.\n\nHe passed away a year ago, the doctor said his heart gave away suddenly.\nHe WAS quite large, always loved food, but a kinder man you could not find.\nHe and Tylda were happily married as far as I know and they even took in that girl, Sheila. His sisters daughter, when she was unable... Well, it's not my story to tell, you should ask Tylda. ",
        "Node4895": "Sheila Travisteen is not the daughter of Tylda Travisteen, she was adopted by Tylda's late husband. She is in fact his niece. ",
        "Node4896": "Do you know anything about the murder?",
        "Node4897": "I do not. Good day.",
        "Node4898": "Did you know Mayor Dellry at all?",
        "Node4899": "Not in particular. You could say I knew him well enough, as much as I care to know anyone, which is not much.\n\nYou have a good day now.",
        "Node4900": "Have you seen anything suspicious around here recently?",
        "Node4901": "You mean any murderers lurking about? No, I have not. \n\nGood day.",
        "Node4902": "Did you close your shop recently? And then reopen it today?\nWhy?",
        "Node4903": "That's three questions, but fine. I did.\n\nI had to close the store down to make some repairs, it took longer than I would have liked, I'm not as young as I used to be. That's the truth of it. \n\nThe Mayor being murdered at the same time is a complete coincidence I assure you. Your young an eager mind is sure to want to make some connection, like a storybook. But this is the real world, coincidences happen, and people die.  ",
        "Node4904": "What kind of repairs? If I may ask?",
        "Node4905": "If you must know it was a broken window. I broke it while sweeping the floor. There, the big mystery has been solved. Aren't you a good detective!\n\nNow run along, I have work to do here. Good day.",
        "Node4906": "Mr Johes the Apothecary, broke his window recently, and had to shut down the store for several days repairing it.\n\nHe broke the window while sweeping the floor.\n\nAt least that is what he claims.",
        "Node4907": "Listen pal, I'm gonna ask you some questions, and you are going to answer them. Is that clear?",
        "Node4908": "Did you kill the Mayor?",
        "Node4909": "I did not.\nGood day.",
        "Node4910": "Well now. Not so boring after all. I guess I was wrong about you.\nGo on then, ask away.",
        "Node5": "Ok... This is the tutorial for the game. \nRight... tutorial... lets do this!",
        "Node584": "Oh ok, sorry.",
        "Node6": "Ok, so you can move using the WASD keys, as you do in most games.\n\nYou can also use the movement keys... but I'm not sure why you would want to... ",
        "Node64": "Ok, so.. \nI'm an apprentice to Father Djonsicus here in the Church.",
        "Node65": "I'm new here, but this village is... \nI don't actually remember the name of the Village.. \nSorry. As I said, I'm new, I just arrived a few days ago actually.",
        "Node66": "Anyway, there is not a lot of people in the village at the moment, \nmost are away at some festival I believe. \nAnd I've mostly been doing chores and required reading.",
        "Node7": "I don't know. Maybe you like using the movement keys instead of the WASD keys.\n\nThat's up to you.. I don't... it really has nothing to do with me.\nYou can use either, its fine... really.",
        "Node752": "WHAAAAT!! WHO...!! WHY ME????\n\nAre you serious? I must be the least qualified person for this job in the entire Village. I literally don't know anyone! I can't even remember the name of this place. ",
        "Node753": "Wait, someone got killed?\nWho, and how? Are you certain it was murder?\n\nThere are not that many people in the village, if someone did this that person could not be far.",
        "Node754": "Yes! This is exactly the kind of thing I have been waiting for!\n\nThank you for trusting in me sir. I will not let you down, I was born for this!",
        "Node755": "Calm down Thack, this is a serious situation.\nA man is dead, and it does not look accidental. This has not happened here since... well, it's been awhile.\n\nYou are the perfect person to investigate Thack, simply BECAUSE you do not know anyone. You are the only person I can trust had no part in this. \n",
        "Node756": "This is a small village, everyone here knows everyone else.\nWhen something like this happens, it is likely many, if not everyone here knows at least something about it.\n\nIt is also just as likely that everyone will make up their own theories and use it as justification to accuse anyone that feel have slighted them in some way or other.",
        "Node757": "I need you to be the impartial witness. Ask everyone, about everything, but keep a polite tounge, and try to consider what people are telling you.\n\nPeople rarely say what they truly mean, if you are to unravel this mystery, you will need to hear what they are not saying, and I think you can do just that.",
        "Node758": "Good, you react as I had hoped. With curiosity, not emotion.\n\nThis is why I want you to handle this investigation. Tyford has not had a murder since... Well it's been awhile. Suffice it to say our Village will be torn once people get back from the festival in Brountown. If you can get to the bottom of what happened before then we can focus on comforting those affected, not have everyone accuse each other wildly. ",
        "Node759": "I'm not sure, why can't you do it?\n\nThey would be far more likely to tell you truth then me.",
        "Node760": "Alright, go on. Who is the victim?",
        "Node761": "No, I cannot. I take confessions, as such I cannot reveal what is told to me in confidence. ",
        "Node762": "I understand, please go on, who is the victim?",
        "Node763": "Wait a minute, if you take confessions, then you should already know who the murderer is, at least have some knowledge of who MIGHT have done it!",
        "Node764": "Thack, confessions is a divine sacrament. In confessions I am a vessel for the Gods themselves, betraying that trust, directly or indirectly is something I will never do.\n\nLet it go Thack. You have other things to focus on.",
        "Node766": "Also our Village is called Tyford. As you should well know.",
        "Node767": "The victim is our mayor, Mayor Dellry. He died during the night, in a most... gruesome manner.\n\nYou will have to see the body yourself, I am sorry Thack, I cannot spare you this. You will find him in his office, in the second floor of his home. ",
        "Node768": "Thack, this is no time for sarcasm. A man is dead.\n",
        "Node769": "Mayor Dellry has been killed.\n\nHis body can be found in his home, on the second floor, in his office.\n\nEveryone in the village can be asked about this card.",
        "Node8": "Ok, moving around, easy right?\n\nSecondly the rest of the game... \nSo this is an RPG, it really is.\nBut, its probably different from games you've played before.",
        "Node9": "I mean. There is no combat here, this game is about... \nyou know... dialogue... talking to people. \nThinking about what they say, and so on...",
        "Node937": "I'm sorry. I don't know why I even said that. Who died?",
        "Node939": "Oh no sir. I am totally serious.\nI truly believe I was called for this. This is perhaps the most exiting thing that has ever happened to me. I am ready! I ",
        "Node940": "Well ok Thack. Your enthusiasm is helpful, if surprising.\nThis is the most harrowing crime we have seen here in Tyford since... Well, it's been awhile.",
        "Node941": "Talk to the other villagers, the few that are not away at the Harvest festival in Brountown. I have alerted the few that are here. Now I must write a letter for the Township, and prepare the funeral arrangements.\n\nYou are on your own from now on Thack. The Village is not large, you will find your way around. ",
        "Node942": "I have one advice for you.\n\nWhen you talk to people do not be too rude, but also do not be too polite.\nA murder investigation is a serious affair, do not hold yourself to propriety, nothing matters more than solving this. "
