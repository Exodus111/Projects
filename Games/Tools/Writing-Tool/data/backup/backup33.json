        "Node9": "I mean. There is no combat here, this game is about... \nyou know... dialogue... talking to people. \nThinking about what they say, and so on...",
        "Node937": "I'm sorry. I don't know why I even said that. Who died?",
        "Node939": "Oh no sir. I am totally serious.\nI truly believe I was called for this. This is perhaps the most exiting thing that has ever happened to me. I am ready! I ",
