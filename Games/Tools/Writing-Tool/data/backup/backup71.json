        "Node754": "Yes! This is exactly the kind of thing I have been waiting for!\n\nThank you for trusting in me sir. I will not let you down, I was born for this!",
        "Node755": "Calm down Thack, this is a serious situation.\nA man is dead, and it does not look accidental. This has not happened here since... well, it's been awhile.\n\nYou are the perfect person to investigate Thack, simply BECAUSE you do not know anyone. You are the only person I can trust had no part in this. \n",
        "Node756": "This is a small village, everyone here knows everyone else.\nWhen something like this happens, it is likely many, if not everyone here knows at least something about it.\n\nIt is also just as likely that everyone will make up their own theories and use it as justification to accuse anyone that feel have slighted them in some way or other.",
        "Node757": "I need you to be the impartial witness. Ask everyone, about everything, but keep a polite tounge, and try to consider what people are telling you.\n\nPeople rarely say what they truly mean, if you are to unravel this mystery, you will need to hear what they are not saying, and I think you can do just that.",
        "Node758": "Good, you react as I had hoped. With curiosity, not emotion.\n\nThis is why I want you to handle this investigation. Tyford has not had a murder since... Well it's been awhile. Suffice it to say our Village will be torn once people get back from the festival in Brountown. If you can get to the bottom of what happened before then we can focus on comforting those affected, not have everyone accuse each other wildly. ",
        "Node759": "I'm not sure, why can't you do it?\n\nThey would be far more likely to tell you truth then me.",
        "Node760": "Alright, go on. Who is the victim?",
        "Node761": "No, I cannot. I take confessions, as such I cannot reveal what is told to me in confidence. ",
        "Node762": "I understand, please go on, who is the victim?",
        "Node763": "Wait a minute, if you take confessions, then you should already know who the murderer is, at least have some knowledge of who MIGHT have done it!",
        "Node764": "Thack, confessions is a divine sacrament. In confessions I am a vessel for the Gods themselves, betraying that trust, directly or indirectly is something I will never do.\n\nLet it go Thack. You have other things to focus on.",
        "Node7649": "WHAT'S THAT? YOU WANT A HAT?",
        "Node7650": "NO, I SAID I WANT TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS!",
        "Node7651": "And you also  called me an old bat, my hearing is fine by the way.",
        "Node7652": "I get it, you're joking, that's hilarious.",
        "Node7653": "Oh, I'm so sorry, I did not mean to insult you. Let me start over please!",
        "Node7654": "I'm investigating a murder here. You're really wasting my time you know.",
        "Node7655": "Well, that's all we old folks do, isn't it. We waste your time with our very existence. Don't bother asking me any questions, what could I possibly know about such matters.",
        "Node7656": "Let me be the judge of that please. You might have seen something after all.\n",
        "Node7657": "Like what?",
        "Node7658": "Yes, you are probably right. Someone sitting around waiting for death is not exactly a very useful  person to ask.",
        "Node7659": "Oh, hee hee!\nYou ARE a fun one! I haven't met someone like you since my husband passed away, how refreshing!\n\nGo on, ask me anything, I might surprise you.",
        "Node766": "Also our Village is called Tyford. As you should well know.",
        "Node7660": "No, I don't think so. Good day.",
        "Node7661": "My my, how clever we are. Perhaps you are more then meets the eye, after all, it's not much.\n\nYes, an old lady must take her fun where she can. But that's what you get for being rude to me.",
        "Node7662": "Whats that? You need to speak up! ",
        "Node7663": "Ok, MAY I PLEASE ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS, IT IS IN REGARDS OF THE MURDER!?",
        "Node7664": "DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE MURDER OF THE MAYOR!?",
        "Node7665": "WHAT? Did you say murder? What a dreadful thing to say to an old lady!\nGo away now, leave me alone!",
        "Node7666": "Do you know if Mayor Dellry had any enemies?",
        "Node7667": "Did you see anything the night of the Murder.",
        "Node7668": "What can you tell me about the other villagers?",
        "Node7669": "Would you suspect anyone in the village?",
        "Node767": "The victim is our mayor, Mayor Dellry. He died during the night, in a most... gruesome manner.\n\nYou will have to see the body yourself, I am sorry Thack, I cannot spare you this. You will find him in his office, in the second floor of his home. ",
        "Node7670": "Oh yes, that young boy, Riff, didn't like him very much.\nAlways going on about how bad he was at being the Mayor. \n\nAs if he had ever done anything worthwhile with his life, it's always the inept ones that complain the most about other people.",
        "Node7671": "No, but I did see something the night before.",
        "Node7672": "Quite a lot. I've been here the longest now, my late husband helped build this village, and I make it my business to keep abreast of its comings and goings. ",
        "Node7673": "Of murder? Oh no. Nothing like that, I cannot imagine who could go to such lenghts.",
        "Node7674": "What did you see?",
        "Node7675": "Do you think Riff could have murdered the Mayor? ",
        "Node7676": "Oh no, nothing like that. Riff is loyal to a fault, and his family, they are all loggers, they don't like the Mayor much either.\n\nBut Riff is not exactly very capable, I wouldn't say he really has the ability to plan much of anything. ",
        "Node7677": "Somebody broke into mr Johes Apothecary.\nThey broke a window in the middle of the night, and ran away carrying something.\n\nI don't know what it could have been.",
        "Node7678": "According to Mrs Von Duren, someone broke into the Apothecary the night before the murder.\n\nThe burglar broke the window, and got away with some kind of package.",
        "Node7679": "Is there anything suspicious going on here?",
        "Node768": "Thack, this is no time for sarcasm. A man is dead.\n",
        "Node7680": "Suspicious, goodness yes. That girl, Sheila, I don't trust her. She always plays it so innocent and quiet, but she wraps men around her little finger.\n\nI should know, I used to be just like her. ",
        "Node7681": "Is that so...\n\nI can't really imagine what could be so suspicious about that.",
        "Node7682": "Well, I don't like her, and that's all I'll say about that.",
        "Node7683": "You said Sheila likes to wrap men around their little finger?\n\nWould that also apply to Riff?",
        "Node7684": "Oh yes, that stupid boy is always pining after her, and she barely gives him the time of day. She could have gotten him to do something stupid, I'm sure of it.",
        "Node7685": "Mrs von Duren suspects Riff Tanner and Sheila Travisteen are working together for some reason. She believes Riff's enfatuation with Sheila is making him go along with stupid things.",
        "Node7686": "But he could be a part of it?\t\nAs in, someone could have made him be apart of the murder?",
        "Node7687": "Anything is possible. He is not very smart, but dumb people do bad things all the time.",
        "Node7688": "Oh, come on now. I'm certain a lovely dignified lady such as yourself can assist me on this. It would give us a chance to get to know each better.\n\nWouldn't that be nice? ",
        "Node7689": "Oh my, what a flirt!\nAren't you supposed to be studying to be a priest? I guess a \"man of the cloth\", is still a man.\n\nAlright then, I'll indulge, ask me your questions, but don't shout, I can hear your quite well. ",
        "Node769": "Mayor Dellry has been killed.\n\nHis body can be found in his home, on the second floor, in his office.\n\nEveryone in the village can be asked about this card.",
        "Node7690": "Rude? This is actually pretty important. A man is dead.",
        "Node7691": "Alright, I'm sorry. But maybe you can tell me something about the people here, whom around here are worthy of my suspicions?  ",
        "Node7692": "At my age, everyone I used to know is dead. Nothing new there.\n\nNo, I think we are done here. Good day.",
        "Node7693": "I'll tell you what I know. Somebody broke into Mr Johes apothecary, just two days ago. That would be the day before the murder. I heard a window shatter, and I saw someone run away carrying something in their arms.\n\nAnd before you ask, I don't know who, or even if it was a man or a woman. ",
        "Node7694": "Did the person run fast?",
        "Node7695": "I beg your pardon?",
        "Node7696": "Would you say the person was a fast runner? That could tell us something about his or her age.",
        "Node7697": "Oh I see, very clever.\nYes, this was no old man, he darted down the street faster then I could think of shouting after him. Or her.",
        "Node7698": "Maybe you can tell me something else about the people here?\nWho should I be talking to?",
        "Node7699": "Everyone, I suppose. Specially that Travisteen girl, Sheila. I never liked her, she always plays so coy.",
        "Node7700": "I'm tired now, It's time for my nap. Good day young man.",
        "Node7701": "Hello, how can I help you?",
        "Node8": "Ok, moving around, easy right?\n\nSecondly the rest of the game... \nSo this is an RPG, it really is.\nBut, its probably different from games you've played before.",
        "Node8171": "Hello, I'm here to ask you some questions about the murder, if you don't mind.",
        "Node8172": "Hi. What do you know about the murder of Mayor Dellry?",
        "Node8173": "I'll tell you how you can \"help\" me, by answering some damn questions, and fast!",
        "Node8174": "Yeah I don't know who you are, but I don't have time for this. Bye.",
        "Node8175": "I don't know anything, there. Good bye.",
        "Node8176": "Alright, shoot!",
        "Node8177": "As I'm sure you know Mayor Dellry has been murdered, this happened yesterday. \nDid you see anyone leave or enter the town that you don't know.",
        "Node8178": "None at all. But it is no impossible that I missed someone.\nIf someone came by boat I would see them, but it happens that people walk along the river, and enter the village from there. I'm pretty busy here, and all alone, so I don't have time to look out for people like that.",
        "Node8179": "Where you especially busy yesterday?",
        "Node8180": "Not out of the ordinary I suppose, I do have a lot of woodwork to get through these days, comes with the season. And with my father and brothers all off to the festival I'm doing as well as I can alone here.",
        "Node8181": "Your father owns this mill?",
        "Node8182": "Eh... yeah! You didn't know that?\nThis has been in the family for generations, I grew up working here with my brothers. I'm the youngest of seven you know, but I'm the best at most of it, except maybe my brother Jugas. He is the eldest. ",
        "Node8183": "Tell me about your father.",
        "Node8184": "What is there to say? He has been away for days, besides he quite liked the Mayor. He hasn't killed anyone.\n\nNot since the war anyway.",
        "Node8185": "Your father was in the war?",
        "Node8186": "That he was. Served directly under Lord Halgthard he did.     \nMy father started as a helper cleaning the Lords armor. \n\nLord Halgthards armor was incredibly special, it was magic, made of gold, silver white steel interlaced in beautiful patters. When worn it would send circles of fire around the Lord, he could light up a whole forest at night.\n\nThat's what my father told us anyway. He would always go on about all the magic. My brother Jugas doesn't believe him, but I do. Why make something like that up?  ",
        "Node8187": "Can you think of anyone that would want to kill the Mayor? ",
        "Node8188": "No, not really. Everyone liked him. ",
        "Node8745": "People walk along the river? Does that happen a lot?",
        "Node8746": "Yes, people walk along the river... It happens as ofter as you would expect.",
        "Node8747": "Festival? What festival?",
        "Node8748": "How do you not know about the festival at Browntown? \nThe one everyone is away at? Why are you even asking about that?",
        "Node8749": "Tell me about your brother.",
        "Node8750": "Why? He is miles away. Why would you even ask me about him?",
        "Node8751": "You know what, I have better things to do than this. \nGood day!",
        "Node8752": "Hold on, you can't just brush me off like that.\nI have the authority to arrest you, it's over Riff, I know what you did.",
        "Node8753": "WHAT!!?? No, no no no NO!\nI only took the box, I didn't even know there was a wand in it!",
        "Node8754": "What wand? What box?\nDid someone put you up to this?",
        "Node8755": "What do you mean 'what box', you said you know everything!",
        "Node8756": "You might as well confess to everything, make this easier on yourself.",
        "Node8757": "Wait a minute, what do you know exactly little boy!?",
        "Node8758": "This is important dammit, tell me everything, right now!",
        "Node8759": "...",
        "Node8760": "Refusing to talk will get you nowhere!\n\nDid you break into the Mayors Office? Did he catch you in the act?\nIs that why you killed him?\n",
        "Node8761": "Riff is a suspect for the murder of Mayor Dellry.\n\nRiff has confessed to stealing a box, with a wand of some kind, in it.\nIf he broke into the Mayors office to steal it, then was caught, he might have killed the mayor in the moment of desperation. \n\nIt leaves a few questions, what was really in the box. And how did he kill the Mayor?",
        "Node8762": "Refusing to talk will get you nowhere!\n\nWere YOU the one to break into Mr Johes Apothecary?\nDid you steal this 'box' there? What was in it?",
        "Node8763": "You are crazy, leave me alone!",
        "Node8764": "I'm not saying another word, get out!",
        "Node8765": "Riff might have been the one to break into Mr Johes Apothecary.\nHe has confessed to stealing a box of some kind, with some kind of wand inside it.",
        "Node8766": "Hold on now, Id also like to ask you a little about the girls in this village.\nSurely you know something about that topic. ",
        "Node8767": "Girls? You mean Sheila?",
        "Node8768": "Sheila is the girl in the general goods store right?\nDo you know her well?",
        "Node8769": "Yeah,you and Sheila huh?",
        "Node8770": "I guess. But Sheila is not... I mean, she is very special.\nSometimes we talk for hours, and sometimes she will barely say anything.\n\nI think she sees me as a friend.",
        "Node8771": "What can you tell me about her?",
        "Node8772": "You should just go for it, what have you got to lose?",
        "Node8773": "Sure little man, I will not be taking advice from you about this.\n\nI think we're done here.",
        "Node8774": "Well, she is not Tylda's daughter, despite what they say.\nTylda is her Aunt, in law even.\n\nHer real mom was mister Travisteens sister.",
        "Node8775": "Really? How did she come to live here?",
        "Node8776": "Well, I shouldn't really say.\nRumor is her mom, her real mom, was a 'companion lady' to officers during the war. And she was killed by a jealous boyfried.\n\nThat's what my brothers told me anyway.",
        "Node8777": "Apparently Sheila Travisteen, the girl in the General Goods store, is not the daughter of Tylda Travisteen, but her niese.\n\nHer real mom is the sister to the late mister Travisteen.\nThere is a rumor that she was a 'companion lady' for military officers during the war. But she was killed by a jealous boyfriend.  ",
        "Node8778": "Is there anything else you can tell me?",
        "Node8779": "Alright, thanks, that will be all.",
        "Node8780": "No, that's it. Good day.",
        "Node8781": "Hi, can I help you?",
        "Node8782": "Hi, yeah I'd like to ask you some questions about the murder if I may.",
        "Node8783": "Do you know anything about Mayor Dellry's murder?",
        "Node8784": "Damn, you're hot. Howabout you come to my room so we can talk some more?",
        "Node8785": "Not. Going. to happen. Bye now!",
        "Node8786": "No, you may not. I'm busy right now, come back some other time.\nBye!",
        "Node8787": "Why would I know anyting about that?",
        "Node8788": "I don't know, I'm asking everyone.\nDid you perhaps see something suspicious, or did someone you have not seen before enter the village?",
        "Node8789": "I notice you are not answering my question.\n\nDo you know anything? Maybe you saw something? Anything at all?",
        "Node8790": "You mean like a stranger?\nI might have seen someone like that.",
        "Node8792": "Why would I know anything? Ask Tylda.",
        "Node8793": "You've seen someone in the village you did not recognize?\nWhy? When?",
        "Node8794": "So... I'm not sure. I think it was a day ago, or maybe two.\nI never saw his face, but it was a guy, and he was wearing a brown cloak, you know, with a hood.  ",
        "Node8797": "If you couldn't see his face, how do you know it was a stranger?",
        "Node8798": "Well... Who could it be? He was taller than Riff, he could walk without a cane so it wasn't mister Johes. Jarod is too broad shouldered, I would have recognized him, and why would father Djonsicus walk around wearing a cloak like that? \n\nListen, believe me or don't, I'm just telling you what I saw. ",
        "Node8799": "Sheila claims to have seen a mysterious stranger wandering around the village a day or two before the murder.\n\nThe stranger was wearing a brown cloak, with a hood that covered his face.",
        "Node8800": "Ok, I believe you. I will ask around about this stranger.\n\nCan you tell me anything else you think I should know?",
        "Node8801": "Not really. Have a nice day!",
        "Node8802": "Hmm, well, I'll look into it I guess.\nBut I was also meaning to ask you a few things about yourself if you don't mind.",
        "Node8803": "Ok, what do you want to know?",
        "Node8804": "Tell me about yourself, have you lived here long?",
        "Node8805": "What kind of a question is that? Have yYOU lived here long?\nWhy don't you just talk to Tylda.",
        "Node8806": "Wait, hold up. I am very sorry. I totally messed up.\nLet me try again, I did not mean to come off as rude I promise you.\n\nYou are just, boy you are pretty... Ok, sorry. I got confused for a second. I will keep it totally professional I promise. Just give me another chance please. I was just unprepared for... well, you.",
        "Node8807": "Oh you're a flirt, alright. I'll give you another chance. What did you want?",
        "Node8808": "Tylda? Yeah I'm sure she would happily talk my ears off, and feed my some pasteries, and make some hot chocolate, and tell me her entire life story, but I'm not really on the market for another Nana right now.\n\nNo offense. ",
        "Node8809": "That's funny, she IS totally like that.\n\nOk, try again, what did you want to know?",
        "Node8810": "How long have you been here?",
        "Node8811": "Tell me more about Tylda.",
        "Node8812": "Ok, the truth is I've only been here for a few years. Uncle Travisteen brought me here to live with him, it's nice, I like it.",
        "Node8813": "Alright. Well, she is not really my mom, though she makes me call her that.\nShes actually my aunt, or rather her husband was my Uncle.\n\nBut she is super nice though, and I like living here, it's nice.",
        "Node8814": "So, Travisteen was your uncle, what happened to your mom and dad?",
        "Node8815": "Uh... my dad died when I was little, and my mom was super poor, so she thought I would have a better life here.",
        "Node8816": "Alright. That's all for now I think. I've got things to do, feel free to come by some other time. Bye!",
        "Node8818": "Can I ask you if you are seeing anyone?",
        "Node8819": "Well, there was this murder you know. I'm in charge of finding the murderer.\nWould you happen to have seen anything?",
        "Node8820": "No, not really. So sorry. Ok, bye.",
        "Node8821": "No, I'm not. I mean, Riff comes around a lot. But he is such a lost puppy sometimes, I like to talk to him.",
        "Node8822": "You and Riff huh, how is that going?",
        "Node8823": "No, there is no 'me and Riff', and besides lately he's been super busy with something, and he won't tell me what it is.",
        "Node8824": "Busy? Busy how, with what?",
        "Node8825": "I just told you he didn't say.\nBut it must be serious if he wont tell me. Something about a box I think.",
        "Node8826": "A box? What kind of box?",
        "Node8827": "I don't know. He said to get the box, that's all. Then he wouldn't answer me when I asked him about it. That's all I know. And I gotta go, good bye.\n\n",
        "Node9": "I mean. There is no combat here, this game is about... \nyou know... dialogue... talking to people. \nThinking about what they say, and so on...",
        "Node937": "I'm sorry. I don't know why I even said that. Who died?",
        "Node939": "Oh no sir. I am totally serious.\nI truly believe I was called for this. This is perhaps the most exiting thing that has ever happened to me. I am ready! I ",
        "Node940": "Well ok Thack. Your enthusiasm is helpful, if surprising.\nThis is the most harrowing crime we have seen here in Tyford since... Well, it's been awhile.",
        "Node941": "Talk to the other villagers, the few that are not away at the Harvest festival in Brountown. I have alerted the few that are here. Now I must write a letter for the Township, and prepare the funeral arrangements.\n\nYou are on your own from now on Thack. The Village is not large, you will find your way around. ",
        "Node942": "I have one advice for you.\n\nWhen you talk to people do not be too rude, but also do not be too polite.\nA murder investigation is a serious affair, do not hold yourself to propriety, nothing matters more than solving this. "
