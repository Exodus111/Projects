His sisters daughter, when she was unable... Well, it's not my story to tell, you should ask Tylda. ",
        "Node4895": "Sheila Travisteen is not the daughter of Tylda Travisteen, she was adopted by Tylda's late husband. She is in fact his niece. ",
        "Node4896": "Do you know anything about the murder?",
        "Node4897": "I do not. Good day.",
        "Node4898": "Did you know Mayor Dellry at all?",
        "Node4899": "Not in particular. You could say I knew him well enough, as much as I care to know anyone, which is not much.\n\nYou have a good day now.",
        "Node4900": "Have you seen anything suspicious around here recently?",
        "Node4901": "You mean any murderers lurking about? No, I have not. \n\nGood day.",
        "Node4902": "Did you close your shop recently? And then reopen it today?\nWhy?",
        "Node4903": "That's three questions, but fine. I did.\n\nI had to close the store down to make some repairs, it took longer than I would have liked, I'm not as young as I used to be. That's the truth of it. \n\nThe Mayor being murdered at the same time is a complete coincidence I assure you. Your young an eager mind is sure to want to make some connection, like a storybook. But this is the real world, coincidences happen, and people die.  ",
        "Node4904": "What kind of repairs? If I may ask?",
        "Node4905": "If you must know it was a broken window. I broke it while sweeping the floor. There, the big mystery has been solved. Aren't you a good detective!\n\nNow run along, I have work to do here. Good day.",
        "Node4906": "Mr Johes the Apothecary, broke his window recently, and had to shut down the store for several days repairing it.\n\nHe broke the window while sweeping the floor.\n\nAt least that is what he claims.",
        "Node4907": "Listen pal, I'm gonna ask you some questions, and you are going to answer them. Is that clear?",
        "Node4908": "Did you kill the Mayor?",
        "Node4909": "I did not.\nGood day.",
        "Node4910": "Well now. Not so boring after all. I guess I was wrong about you.\nGo on then, ask away.",
        "Node5": "And for SOME reason I can\u2019t fathom, I have been asked to solve it. \nMe!?\nI don\u2019t know the first thing about investigations, or interrogations. \nAt all.",
        "Node5288": "Wait... You don't mind me being rude?",
        "Node5289": "Not at all, I find polite people to, more often than not, be the worst kinds of people. A man that is rude is being perfectly honest. Not enough of that in the world if you ask me.",
        "Node5290": "What do you know about the murder of Mayor Dellry?",
        "Node5291": "I've heard that you closed down your store right before the murder happened, that's kind of suspicious. What happened?",
        "Node5292": "I heard your son served in the war, a scout of some kind?",
        "Node5293": "What can you tell me about the other people in the Village?",
        "Node5294": "So, what's your story?",
        "Node5295": "What do you know of the war?",
        "Node5673": "Nothing. I heard nothing, I saw nothing, and I have no idea who it could be.",
        "Node5674": "The Mayor had no enemies that you know of?",
        "Node5675": "Did you go see the body?",
        "Node5676": "I have yes. Gruesome, and I have no idea what could have done that.",
        "Node5677": "Not really. He was the Mayor, of the Township that is, which includes seven villages, so it could have been someone from far away, however unlikely that might be.",
        "Node5678": "I suffered a broken window. Took me two days to repair it as I had some missing tools.",
        "Node5679": "The Apothecary, mr Johes had a broken window two days before the murder.",
        "Node5680": "Broken how? Did someone break in here?",
        "Node5681": "Well, if you must know, yes. Someone broke in, but nothing was taken.\nI don't know who it was, I slept through the whole thing.\n\nBut someone was in here, for some reason. ",
        "Node5682": "Someone broke in to the Apothecary two days ago, according to mr Johes they did not actually take anything.",
        "Node5683": "Why would they not steal anything?\nCould this have been someone looking for a place to sleep?",
        "Node5684": "Not taking anything is strange, but perhaps it was a drunken misunderstanding of some kind. Who could have done that?",
        "Node5685": "C'mon tell the truth, nobody breaks in and steals nothing. What are you hiding?",
        "Node5686": "Oh this is over! Get the fuck out of my store right now!\nWe are done here!",
        "Node584": "Oh ok, sorry.",
        "Node6": "So. I need some help. \nThat\u2019s where you come in. \nYou play video games right? \nYou can figure stuff out? \nIf you help me. We can do that. You are my only hope. ",
        "Node6064": "Yes yes, I have not patience for your theories. Go play detective somewhere else.",
        "Node6065": "Something like that yes, he was with the forward support battalion of his majesties forces. But his squad was mostly used for scouting operations.\n\nBut war is war, and sons don't always come back. No matter how gifted they mauy be at what they do. ",
        "Node6066": "He told you a lot about it?",
        "Node6067": "He did yes. His mother passed away when he was born, so we only ever had each other. He would tell me everything. \n\nHe also left a diary hidden among his belongings that was returned to me. ",
        "Node6068": "A diary? I would love to see that.",
        "Node6069": "You cannot, I burned it after his funeral. As I said I found it hidden, it would not have been given to me if they knew about it. \n\nThe military does not take breaches of security lightly. I did read it of course, but it would do no good keeping such a thing around. ",
        "Node6070": "I'm so sorry, for your loss. Did you take it hard?",
        "Node6071": "What kind a of a stupid question is that?\n\nI think we are done here, good day.",
        "Node6072": "I'm so sorry, you must miss him terribly.",
        "Node6073": "He was my son you moron, of course I... Ok we're done here. Good day.",
        "Node6074": "You read it? What was in it?",
        "Node6075": "So he hid it somehow? Did he hide anything else?",
        "Node6076": "He did not no, whatever gave you that impression.",
        "Node6077": "The sorts of things a young man would write about if he was living in a war zone. He was a good writer, an intelligent man, and that's not just me saying it.",
        "Node6078": "I'm not a historian. Go ask someone else to tell you the things you should already know.",
        "Node6079": "I'm an Apothecary in a small village, what do you think my \"story\" is.\nAre these the kind of questions the great detective is going to focus on?",
        "Node6080": "Something pertinent to your case you mean?\n\nLet's see. The von Duren widow rarely sleeps, she loves to spy on other people, if you have not already talked to her you should.\n\nTylda, she runs the general store, loves to gossip, she might know something I suppose. Other than that you are on your own. ",
        "Node64": "Ok, so.. \nI'm an apprentice to Father Djonsicus here in the Church.",
        "Node6458": "I was told it was more than that, didn't the two of you have an argument?",
        "Node6459": "Really? Are you sure? \nIt would be a masked or hooded figure, typically carrying a knife or dagger with blood dripping from it?\n\nThey are known to make long monologues and laugh hysterially.  ",
        "Node6460": "Who doesn't have arguments from time to time?\n\nAnyway that's ancient history, I can't imagine you told you about that, we buried the hatched years ago. The truth is there is something wrong in the village, has been for awhile. I don't believe this was the first murder to occur here.\n\nI believe Travisteen was murdered as well. I don't know by whom, but the way he died was not natural. I should know, many alchemical combinations could produce a heart attack like the one he had.  ",
        "Node65": "I'm new here, but this village is... \nI don't actually remember the name of the Village.. \nSorry. As I said, I'm new, I just arrived a few days ago actually.",
        "Node66": "Anyway, there is not a lot of people in the village at the moment, \nmost are away at some festival I believe. \nAnd I've mostly been doing chores and required reading.",
        "Node6838": "Didn't your son work for him at some point?",
        "Node6839": "No... My son went to military school as a young man, he never worked...\n\nAre you making up nonsense now? We are done. Have a good day!",
        "Node6840": "Alright, thanks.",
        "Node6841": "Really? Are you saying he was poisoned? How could do that?",
        "Node6842": "Who? Anyone. Anyone could do that really. This is a small village, anyone could have put something in his food. But this is useless speculation. I told you what I think, that will have to do. \n\nGood luck to you.",
        "Node6843": "Mr Johes, the Apothecary, has a theory about the death of Travisteen, the owner of the general goods store, a year ago.\n\nMr Johes believes Travisteen was also murdered, by poison, and that the two  murders are somehow linked, or committed by the same person. ",
        "Node6844": "As opposed to being an intelligent writer and a good man I suppose?",
        "Node6845": "Was that a joke? Very dry wit. I like it.\n\nAlright, I'll tell you more about the war. He wrote about the followers camp, do you know what that is? No? \n\nIt's a group of follower that travels a few hours behind the actual army. They are gamblers, wine merchants and... \"Ladies of the night\". If you know what I mean.\n\nMy son's commander was a noble, the seventh son of the house of Althia, if you'll believe that. And boy did he like the follower camps.    \nHalf my sons deployments he spent standing on guard outside those kinds of tents, the ones with a red light.\n\nAnyway, yes war, it's never what they tell you in the stories.",
        "Node6846": "The follower camp was a camp traveling a few hours behind an army.\n\nIt is a place for soldiers to sneak away, gamble, drink, and prostitution.\n ",
        "Node6847": "Well hold on, I only ask because someone told me you barely cried at his funeral.",
        "Node6848": "Don't dismiss me like this, I can have you arrested for that you know!",
        "Node6849": "FUCK! OFF!",
        "Node6850": "*sigh*\n\nThat is only because I was angry. Angry at the Gods for taking my son away, after delivering him alive from the pit of war.\n\nSo silly, being mad at imaginary beings. Sorry, no offense to you, but it is how I feel. ",
        "Node6851": "That's ok. I'm just an apprentice anyway.\n\nHow did he die, if you don't mind me asking?",
        "Node6852": "I understand, maybe your faith will return when the pain subsides.",
        "Node6853": "You think the pain of losing a son can 'subside'??\nI'm done talking to a child. Good day.",
        "Node6854": "He came back wounded. He was making a recovery, but at some point the wound got infected again. It got progressively worse, and he was dead in a few days.",
        "Node6855": "That is terrible. I am so sorry. Well I know I already said that.\nI'll leave you alone.",
        "Node6856": "Do you have any reason to believe that his death was not natural.\n",
        "Node6857": "I do.\n\nI've long suspected it, same with Travisteens death a year later. There is something afoot in the village. These deaths are not natural, I'm sure of it. And now the Mayor, looking like that? This is getting worse. \n\nTravisteen could have been poisoned as well. But the Mayor, if it is done by the same person he is no longer bothering to be careful.",
        "Node6858": "Mr Johes the Apothecary believes his son was murdered by Poison.\n\nAnd that, perhaps this person is the same as the killer of the Mayor.",
        "Node7": "Help me interrogate the other villagers, one of them did this. \nOne of them somehow killed a guy in that way. I don\u2019t even know how.\nTogether, we can find the murderer and have that person put to Justice.",
        "Node7236": "Hello there young man.",
        "Node7237": "Hello ma'am, If you don't mind I'd like to ask you some questions.",
        "Node7238": "Do you know anything about the murder of the Mayor?",
        "Node7239": "HELLO, I'M GOING TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS NOW!\nCan you even hear me you old bat!?",
        "Node752": "WHAAAAT!! WHO...!! WHY ME????\n\nAre you serious? I must be the least qualified person for this job in the entire Village. I literally don't know anyone! I can't even remember the name of this place. ",
        "Node753": "Wait, someone got killed?\nWho, and how? Are you certain it was murder?\n\nThere are not that many people in the village, if someone did this that person could not be far.",
        "Node754": "Yes! This is exactly the kind of thing I have been waiting for!\n\nThank you for trusting in me sir. I will not let you down, I was born for this!",
        "Node755": "Calm down Thack, this is a serious situation.\nA man is dead, and it does not look accidental. This has not happened here since... well, it's been awhile.\n\nYou are the perfect person to investigate Thack, simply BECAUSE you do not know anyone. You are the only person I can trust had no part in this. \n",
        "Node756": "This is a small village, everyone here knows everyone else.\nWhen something like this happens, it is likely many, if not everyone here knows at least something about it.\n\nIt is also just as likely that everyone will make up their own theories and use it as justification to accuse anyone that feel have slighted them in some way or other.",
        "Node757": "I need you to be the impartial witness. Ask everyone, about everything, but keep a polite tounge, and try to consider what people are telling you.\n\nPeople rarely say what they truly mean, if you are to unravel this mystery, you will need to hear what they are not saying, and I think you can do just that.",
        "Node758": "Good, you react as I had hoped. With curiosity, not emotion.\n\nThis is why I want you to handle this investigation. Tyford has not had a murder since... Well it's been awhile. Suffice it to say our Village will be torn once people get back from the festival in Brountown. If you can get to the bottom of what happened before then we can focus on comforting those affected, not have everyone accuse each other wildly. ",
        "Node759": "I'm not sure, why can't you do it?\n\nThey would be far more likely to tell you truth then me.",
        "Node760": "Alright, go on. Who is the victim?",
        "Node761": "No, I cannot. I take confessions, as such I cannot reveal what is told to me in confidence. ",
        "Node762": "I understand, please go on, who is the victim?",
        "Node763": "Wait a minute, if you take confessions, then you should already know who the murderer is, at least have some knowledge of who MIGHT have done it!",
        "Node764": "Thack, confessions is a divine sacrament. In confessions I am a vessel for the Gods themselves, betraying that trust, directly or indirectly is something I will never do.\n\nLet it go Thack. You have other things to focus on.",
        "Node7649": "WHAT'S THAT? YOU WANT A HAT?",
        "Node7650": "NO, I SAID I WANT TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS!",
        "Node7651": "And you also  called me an old bat, my hearing is fine by the way.",
        "Node7652": "I get it, you're joking, that's hilarious.",
        "Node7653": "Oh, I'm so sorry, I did not mean to insult you. Let me start over please!",
        "Node7654": "I'm investigating a murder here. You're really wasting my time you know.",
        "Node7655": "Well, that's all we old folks do, isn't it. We waste your time with our very existence. Don't bother asking me any questions, what could I possibly know about such matters.",
        "Node7656": "Let me be the judge of that please. You might have seen something after all.\n",
        "Node7657": "Like what?",
        "Node7658": "Yes, you are probably right. Someone sitting around waiting for death is not exactly a very useful  person to ask.",
        "Node7659": "Oh, hee hee!\nYou ARE a fun one! I haven't met someone like you since my husband passed away, how refreshing!\n\nGo on, ask me anything, I might surprise you.",
        "Node766": "Also our Village is called Tyford. As you should well know.",
        "Node7660": "No, I don't think so. Good day.",
        "Node7661": "My my, how clever we are. Perhaps you are more then meets the eye, after all, it's not much.\n\nYes, an old lady must take her fun where she can. But that's what you get for being rude to me.",
        "Node7662": "Whats that? You need to speak up! ",
        "Node7663": "Ok, MAY I PLEASE ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS, IT IS IN REGARDS OF THE MURDER!?",
        "Node7664": "DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE MURDER OF THE MAYOR!?",
        "Node7665": "WHAT? Did you say murder? What a dreadful thing to say to an old lady!\nGo away now, leave me alone!",
        "Node7666": "Do you know if Mayor Dellry had any enemies?",
        "Node7667": "Did you see anything the night of the Murder.",
        "Node7668": "What can you tell me about the other villagers?",
        "Node7669": "Would you suspect anyone in the village?",
        "Node767": "The victim is our mayor, Mayor Dellry. He died during the night, in a most... gruesome manner.\n\nYou will have to see the body yourself, I am sorry Thack, I cannot spare you this. You will find him in his office, on the second floor of his home. ",
        "Node7670": "Oh yes, that young boy, Riff, didn't like him very much.\nAlways going on about how bad he was at being the Mayor. \n\nAs if he had ever done anything worthwhile with his life, it's always the inept ones that complain the most about other people.",
        "Node7671": "No, but I did see something the night before.",
        "Node7672": "Quite a lot. I've been here the longest now, my late husband helped build this village, and I make it my business to keep abreast of its comings and goings. ",
        "Node7673": "Of murder? Oh no. Nothing like that, I cannot imagine who could go to such lenghts.",
        "Node7674": "What did you see?",
        "Node7675": "Do you think Riff could have murdered the Mayor? ",
        "Node7676": "Oh no, nothing like that. Riff is loyal to a fault, and his family, they are all loggers, they don't like the Mayor much either.\n\nBut Riff is not exactly very capable, I wouldn't say he really has the ability to plan much of anything. ",
        "Node7677": "Somebody broke into mr Johes Apothecary.\nThey broke a window in the middle of the night, and ran away carrying something.\n\nI don't know what it could have been.",
        "Node7678": "According to Mrs Von Duren, someone broke into the Apothecary the night before the murder.\n\nThe burglar broke the window, and got away with some kind of package.",
        "Node7679": "Is there anything suspicious going on here?",
        "Node768": "Thack, this is no time for sarcasm. A man is dead.\n",
        "Node7680": "Suspicious, goodness yes. That girl, Sheila, I don't trust her. She always plays it so innocent and quiet, but she wraps men around her little finger.\n\nI should know, I used to be just like her. ",
        "Node7681": "Is that so...\n\nI can't really imagine what could be so suspicious about that.",
        "Node7682": "Well, I don't like her, and that's all I'll say about that.",
        "Node7683": "You said Sheila likes to wrap men around their little finger?\n\nWould that also apply to Riff?",
        "Node7684": "Oh yes, that stupid boy is always pining after her, and she barely gives him the time of day. She could have gotten him to do something stupid, I'm sure of it.",
        "Node7685": "Mrs von Duren suspects Riff Tanner and Sheila Travisteen are working together for some reason. She believes Riff's enfatuation with Sheila is making him go along with stupid things.",
        "Node7686": "But he could be a part of it?\t\nAs in, someone could have made him be apart of the murder?",
        "Node7687": "Anything is possible. He is not very smart, but dumb people do bad things all the time.",
        "Node7688": "Oh, come on now. I'm certain a lovely dignified lady such as yourself can assist me on this. It would give us a chance to get to know each better.\n\nWouldn't that be nice? ",
        "Node7689": "Oh my, what a flirt!\nAren't you supposed to be studying to be a priest? I guess a \"man of the cloth\", is still a man.\n\nAlright then, I'll indulge, ask me your questions, but don't shout, I can hear your quite well. ",
        "Node769": "Mayor Dellry has been killed.\n\nHis body can be found in his home, on the second floor, in his office.\n\nEveryone in the village can be asked about this card.",
        "Node7690": "Rude? This is actually pretty important. A man is dead.",
        "Node7691": "Alright, I'm sorry. But maybe you can tell me something about the people here, whom around here are worthy of my suspicions?  ",
        "Node7692": "At my age, everyone I used to know is dead. Nothing new there.\n\nNo, I think we are done here. Good day.",
        "Node7693": "I'll tell you what I know. Somebody broke into Mr Johes apothecary, just two days ago. That would be the day before the murder. I heard a window shatter, and I saw someone run away carrying something in their arms.\n\nAnd before you ask, I don't know who, or even if it was a man or a woman. ",
        "Node7694": "Did the person run fast?",
        "Node7695": "I beg your pardon?",
        "Node7696": "Would you say the person was a fast runner? That could tell us something about his or her age.",
        "Node7697": "Oh I see, very clever.\nYes, this was no old man, he darted down the street faster then I could think of shouting after him. Or her.",
        "Node7698": "Maybe you can tell me something else about the people here?\nWho should I be talking to?",
        "Node7699": "Everyone, I suppose. Specially that Travisteen girl, Sheila. I never liked her, she always plays so coy.",
        "Node7700": "I'm tired now, It's time for my nap. Good day young man.",
        "Node7701": "Hello, how can I help you?",
        "Node8": "Ok, moving around, easy right?\n\nSecondly the rest of the game... \nSo this is an RPG, it really is.\nBut, its probably different from games you've played before.",
        "Node8171": "Hello, I'm here to ask you some questions about the murder, if you don't mind.",
        "Node8172": "Hi. What do you know about the murder of Mayor Dellry?",
        "Node8173": "I'll tell you how you can \"help\" me, by answering some damn questions, and fast!",
        "Node8174": "Yeah I don't know who you are, but I don't have time for this. Bye.",
        "Node8175": "I don't know anything, there. Good bye.",
        "Node8176": "Alright, shoot!",
        "Node8177": "As I'm sure you know Mayor Dellry has been murdered, this happened yesterday. \nDid you see anyone leave or enter the town that you don't know.",
        "Node8178": "None at all. But it is no impossible that I missed someone.\nIf someone came by boat I would see them, but it happens that people walk along the river, and enter the village from there. I'm pretty busy here, and all alone, so I don't have time to look out for people like that.",
        "Node8179": "Where you especially busy yesterday?",
        "Node8180": "Not out of the ordinary I suppose, I do have a lot of woodwork to get through these days, comes with the season. And with my father and brothers all off to the festival I'm doing as well as I can alone here.",
        "Node8181": "Your father owns this mill?",
        "Node8182": "Eh... yeah! You didn't know that?\nThis has been in the family for generations, I grew up working here with my brothers. I'm the youngest of seven you know, but I'm the best at most of it, except maybe my brother Jugas. He is the eldest. ",
        "Node8183": "Tell me about your father.",
        "Node8184": "What is there to say? He has been away for days, besides he quite liked the Mayor. He hasn't killed anyone.\n\nNot since the war anyway.",
        "Node8185": "Your father was in the war?",
        "Node8186": "That he was. Served directly under Lord Halgthard he did.     \nMy father started as a helper cleaning the Lords armor. \n\nLord Halgthards armor was incredibly special, it was magic, made of gold, silver white steel interlaced in beautiful patters. When worn it would send circles of fire around the Lord, he could light up a whole forest at night.\n\nThat's what my father told us anyway. He would always go on about all the magic. My brother Jugas doesn't believe him, but I do. Why make something like that up?  ",
        "Node8187": "Can you think of anyone that would want to kill the Mayor? ",
        "Node8188": "No, not really. Everyone liked him. ",
        "Node8745": "People walk along the river? Does that happen a lot?",
        "Node8746": "Yes, people walk along the river... It happens as ofter as you would expect.",
        "Node8747": "Festival? What festival?",
        "Node8748": "How do you not know about the festival at Browntown? \nThe one everyone is away at? Why are you even asking about that?",
        "Node8749": "Tell me about your brother.",
        "Node8750": "Why? He is miles away. Why would you even ask me about him?",
        "Node8751": "You know what, I have better things to do than this. \nGood day!",
        "Node8752": "Hold on, you can't just brush me off like that.\nI have the authority to arrest you, it's over Riff, I know what you did.",
        "Node8753": "WHAT!!?? No, no no no NO!\nI only took the box, I didn't even know there was a wand in it!",
        "Node8754": "What wand? What box?\nDid someone put you up to this?",
        "Node8755": "What do you mean 'what box', you said you know everything!",
        "Node8756": "You might as well confess to everything, make this easier on yourself.",
        "Node8757": "Wait a minute, what do you know exactly little boy!?",
        "Node8758": "This is important dammit, tell me everything, right now!",
        "Node8759": "...",
        "Node8760": "Refusing to talk will get you nowhere!\n\nDid you break into the Mayors Office? Did he catch you in the act?\nIs that why you killed him?\n",
        "Node8761": "Riff is a suspect for the murder of Mayor Dellry.\n\nRiff has confessed to stealing a box, with a wand of some kind, in it.\nIf he broke into the Mayors office to steal it, then was caught, he might have killed the mayor in the moment of desperation. \n\nIt leaves a few questions, what was really in the box. And how did he kill the Mayor?",
        "Node8762": "Refusing to talk will get you nowhere!\n\nWere YOU the one to break into Mr Johes Apothecary?\nDid you steal this 'box' there? What was in it?",
        "Node8763": "You are crazy, leave me alone!",
        "Node8764": "I'm not saying another word, get out!",
        "Node8765": "Riff might have been the one to break into Mr Johes Apothecary.\nHe has confessed to stealing a box of some kind, with some kind of wand inside it.",
        "Node8766": "Hold on now, Id also like to ask you a little about the girls in this village.\nSurely you know something about that topic. ",
        "Node8767": "Girls? You mean Sheila?",
        "Node8768": "Sheila is the girl in the general goods store right?\nDo you know her well?",
        "Node8769": "Yeah,you and Sheila huh?",
        "Node8770": "I guess. But Sheila is not... I mean, she is very special.\nSometimes we talk for hours, and sometimes she will barely say anything.\n\nI think she sees me as a friend.",
        "Node8771": "What can you tell me about her?",
        "Node8772": "You should just go for it, what have you got to lose?",
        "Node8773": "Sure little man, I will not be taking advice from you about this.\n\nI think we're done here.",
        "Node8774": "Well, she is not Tylda's daughter, despite what they say.\nTylda is her Aunt, in law even.\n\nHer real mom was mister Travisteens sister.",
        "Node8775": "Really? How did she come to live here?",
        "Node8776": "Well, I shouldn't really say.\nRumor is her mom, her real mom, was a 'companion lady' to officers during the war. And she was killed by a jealous boyfried.\n\nThat's what my brothers told me anyway.",
        "Node8777": "Apparently Sheila Travisteen, the girl in the General Goods store, is not the daughter of Tylda Travisteen, but her niese.\n\nHer real mom is the sister to the late mister Travisteen.\nThere is a rumor that she was a 'companion lady' for military officers during the war. But she was killed by a jealous boyfriend.  ",
        "Node8778": "Is there anything else you can tell me?",
        "Node8779": "Alright, thanks, that will be all.",
        "Node8780": "No, that's it. Good day.",
        "Node8781": "Hi, can I help you?",
        "Node8782": "Hi, yeah I'd like to ask you some questions about the murder if I may.",
        "Node8783": "Do you know anything about Mayor Dellry's murder?",
        "Node8784": "Damn, you're hot. Howabout you come to my room so we can talk some more?",
        "Node8785": "Not. Going. to happen. Bye now!",
        "Node8786": "No, you may not. I'm busy right now, come back some other time.\nBye!",
        "Node8787": "Why would I know anyting about that?",
        "Node8788": "I don't know, I'm asking everyone.\nDid you perhaps see something suspicious, or did someone you have not seen before enter the village?",
        "Node8789": "I notice you are not answering my question.\n\nDo you know anything? Maybe you saw something? Anything at all?",
        "Node8790": "You mean like a stranger?\nI might have seen someone like that.",
        "Node8792": "Why would I know anything? Ask Tylda.",
        "Node8793": "You've seen someone in the village you did not recognize?\nWhy? When?",
        "Node8794": "So... I'm not sure. I think it was a day ago, or maybe two.\nI never saw his face, but it was a guy, and he was wearing a brown cloak, you know, with a hood.  ",
        "Node8797": "If you couldn't see his face, how do you know it was a stranger?",
        "Node8798": "Well... Who could it be? He was taller than Riff, he could walk without a cane so it wasn't mister Johes. Jarod is too broad shouldered, I would have recognized him, and why would father Djonsicus walk around wearing a cloak like that? \n\nListen, believe me or don't, I'm just telling you what I saw. ",
        "Node8799": "Sheila claims to have seen a mysterious stranger wandering around the village a day or two before the murder.\n\nThe stranger was wearing a brown cloak, with a hood that covered his face.",
        "Node8800": "Ok, I believe you. I will ask around about this stranger.\n\nCan you tell me anything else you think I should know?",
        "Node8801": "Not really. Have a nice day!",
        "Node8802": "Hmm, well, I'll look into it I guess.\nBut I was also meaning to ask you a few things about yourself if you don't mind.",
        "Node8803": "Ok, what do you want to know?",
        "Node8804": "Tell me about yourself, have you lived here long?",
        "Node8805": "What kind of a question is that? Have yYOU lived here long?\nWhy don't you just talk to Tylda.",
        "Node8806": "Wait, hold up. I am very sorry. I totally messed up.\nLet me try again, I did not mean to come off as rude I promise you.\n\nYou are just, boy you are pretty... Ok, sorry. I got confused for a second. I will keep it totally professional I promise. Just give me another chance please. I was just unprepared for... well, you.",
        "Node8807": "Oh you're a flirt, alright. I'll give you another chance. What did you want?",
        "Node8808": "Tylda? Yeah I'm sure she would happily talk my ears off, and feed my some pasteries, and make some hot chocolate, and tell me her entire life story, but I'm not really on the market for another Nana right now.\n\nNo offense. ",
        "Node8809": "That's funny, she IS totally like that.\n\nOk, try again, what did you want to know?",
        "Node8810": "How long have you been here?",
        "Node8811": "Tell me more about Tylda.",
        "Node8812": "Ok, the truth is I've only been here for a few years. Uncle Travisteen brought me here to live with him, it's nice, I like it.",
        "Node8813": "Alright. Well, she is not really my mom, though she makes me call her that.\nShes actually my aunt, or rather her husband was my Uncle.\n\nBut she is super nice though, and I like living here, it's nice.",
        "Node8814": "So, Travisteen was your uncle, what happened to your mom and dad?",
        "Node8815": "Uh... my dad died when I was little, and my mom was super poor, so she thought I would have a better life here.",
        "Node8816": "Alright. That's all for now I think. I've got things to do, feel free to come by some other time. Bye!",
        "Node8818": "Can I ask you if you are seeing anyone?",
        "Node8819": "Well, there was this murder you know. I'm in charge of finding the murderer.\nWould you happen to have seen anything?",
        "Node8820": "No, not really. So sorry. Ok, bye.",
        "Node8821": "No, I'm not. I mean, Riff comes around a lot. But he is such a lost puppy sometimes, I like to talk to him.",
        "Node8822": "You and Riff huh, how is that going?",
        "Node8823": "No, there is no 'me and Riff', and besides lately he's been super busy with something, and he won't tell me what it is.",
        "Node8824": "Busy? Busy how, with what?",
        "Node8825": "I just told you he didn't say.\nBut it must be serious if he wont tell me. Something about a box I think.",
        "Node8826": "A box? What kind of box?",
        "Node8827": "I don't know. He said to get the box, that's all. Then he wouldn't answer me when I asked him about it. That's all I know. And I gotta go, good bye.\n\n",
        "Node8828": "Hullo there young man. How can I help you?",
        "Node8829": "Hello there ma'am, I would like to ask you some questions if you don't mind.",
        "Node8830": "Mind, why on earth would I mind, ask away young man.",
        "Node8831": "Do you know anything about the murder of Mayor Dellry?",
        "Node8832": "Did you know the Mayor at all?",
        "Node8833": "Can you tell me something about yourself and your store?",
        "Node9": "I mean. There is no combat here, this game is about... \nyou know... dialogue... talking to people. \nThinking about what they say, and so on...",
        "Node937": "I'm sorry. I don't know why I even said that. Who died?",
        "Node939": "Oh no sir. I am totally serious.\nI truly believe I was called for this. This is perhaps the most exiting thing that has ever happened to me. I am ready!",
        "Node940": "Very well Thack. Your enthusiasm is helpful, if surprising.\nThis is the most harrowing crime we have seen here in Tyford since... Well, it's been awhile.",
        "Node941": "Talk to the other villagers, the ones that are not away at the Harvest festival in Brountown. I have alerted the few that are here. \nNow I must write a letter for the Township, and prepare the funeral arrangements.\n\nYou are on your own from now on Thack. The Village is not large, you will find your way around. ",
        "Node942": "I have one advice for you.\n\nWhen you talk to people do not be too rude, but also do not be too polite.\nA murder investigation is a serious affair, do not hold yourself to propriety, nothing matters more than solving this. ",
        "Node9516": "Oh dear me no. I can't imagine who could have done a thing like that.\n\nThe Mayor was a well liked man, not just here, but in all the villages of the Township. He'd been a Mayor forever too, almost as long as I can remember.\n\nI still can't believe it was murder, I haven't seen the body, but from what people are saying... Who could do such a thing? Maybe it was some kind of accident.",
        "Node9517": "He would come by the store often enough.\nHim and my late husband would talk about this or that, but I wouldn't say we were close in any way. The Mayor has never had a wife you know, it was quite the scandal at first. But then I supposed everyone got used to it.\n\nThat was years ago though, it doesn't even come up anymore.",
        "Node9518": "An accident? I doubt it, it's not like he slipped and fell.",
        "Node9519": "Township? So he wasn't just the mayor of this village?",
        "Node9520": "Villages don't have mayors dear, towns do. In our case this village and four others makes a township, hence we have a mayor. See how that works? ",
        "Node9521": "Right ok, thanks. That must have slipped by me somehow.",
        "Node9522": "Yes, of course. I knew that.",
        "Node9523": "Of course dear.",
        "Node9524": "Well I don't know. I hope you figure it out somehow, I truly do.",
        "Node9525": "Really? He never had a wife? I had no idea.\nWhy not? Is he... not... that kind of man?",
        "Node9526": "You mean the kind of man to stay home and take care of his mother rather then run off with some wife? I had a cousin like that, quite a lovely man.\n\nI don't think so. The Mayor would travel a lot, I think maybe he was just too busy. ",
        "Node9527": "Travel? Where would he go?",
        "Node9528": "All around the Township first of all, there are 4 villages in total, he would visit them a lot. He had to attent council with other mayors from time to time, that would take him away for longer.\n\nThings like that, official mayoral duties and the like.",
        "Node9529": "The scandal never affected him?",
        "Node9530": "He was a young man back then, the war was still going on, and there weren't a lot of those around. He helped the sawmill get rebuilt after a fire, everyone liked him after that. ",
        "Node9531": "So he was not in the war then?",
        "Node9532": "I don't believe he was no. I'm not sure why, he was never injured or anything like that, not to my eyes anyway. ",
        "Node9533": "Certainly, this is the general goods store, the only one in the village.\nWe sell... well, traders come by a few times a year and we sell whatever they bring us. My husband used to travel to Browntown to pickup essential items every now and then, but since his passing we haven't done that.\n\nThe truth is it hasn't really been necessary, until you arrived this village had not seen any new people moving in for a long time. And I know what everyone wants, and how much of it they need.  ",
        "Node9534": "How did your husband pass away, if you don't mind me asking?",
        "Node9535": "Nothing wrong with asking dear. \nHe passed away last year from some trouble with his stomach. I miss him  dearly, but its just me and Sheila now. Mother and Daughter, so we keep it going together.",
        "Node9536": "So Sheila is your daughter?",
        "Node9537": "Of course, in every way that matters.\n\nYes, she is adopted, we don't usually tell people that, but its no big secret.\nHer mother was too poor you see, the poor dear. So we took the child in to give her a better life. A child should have a mother, so I insisted she called me her mother from then on. ",
        "Node9538": "Really? But what about her real mother. Where is she now?",
        "Node9539": "I AM her 'real' mother. As for the other one, I don't know. She was a beggar or something, I'm not sure she is still alive, but it doesn't matter. Sheila doesn't need her.",
        "Node9540": "Well, you might be her real mother now, but her biological mother is always going to be important in some way. Sheila might want to find her one day to see what has become of her.",
        "Node9541": "Absolute nonsense. There is nothing Sheila could possibly want from that... person.\n\nShe has everything she needs right here, and this is the last I will talk of this.",
        "Node9542": "Traders?\n\nWhen do they come by?",
        "Node9543": "Stomach trouble, could he have been poisoned?",
        "Node9544": "Alright thanks.",
        "Node9545": "Ok, thank you.",
        "Node9546": "I am sorry for getting upset dear. It's my inner 'mamabear' coming out I guess.",
        "Node9547": "Before winter dear, and during spring. Should be a while still.",
        "Node9548": "No, no, no no! I can't imagine who could have done that.\nFather Djonsicus told me he was a big man, who liked his food. It's not the most healthy way to live. That's all.  ",
        "Node9549": "Father Djonsicus said he died because he was too fat?\nHow big was he?",
        "Node9550": "He was a big man, with a stomach. I wouldn't call him enourmous or anything like that, but that is what father Djonsicus said.",
        "Node9551": "Apparently Father Djonsicus diagnosed the death a Mister Travisteen a year ago, as a death caused by his obesity.  ",
        "Node9552": "What do you know about the Mayors murder?",
        "Node9553": "THE MAYOR IS DEAD AND I THINK YOU KILLED HIM!",
        "Node9554": "Oh, dear me. Nothing. Was he really 'murdered' as you say? What happened to him could have been some kind of strange accident.",
        "Node9555": "Accident, are you kidding me? It's like he fell and broke his leg, his body was completely blown apart.",
        "Node9556": "Whatever did kill him was nowhere to be found in his office with his body.\nIf it was an accident, SOMETHING, must have been found with him. \nIt was not, therefore one can only assume someone must have taken it with them.\n\nWhich either means someone killed him, or someone stole something from him after his death.",
        "Node9557": "Well, I didn't see his body, but I suppose you are right.\n\nOh I don't know what it could have been, it's all just so awful. First my husband, now this.",
        "Node9558": "Your husband? He died a year ago didn't he?\nAre you saying the deaths are connected?",
        "Node9559": "No, not at all. How could they be, my husband died of being sick to the stomach, not by some horrible murder.",
        "Node9560": "What? Dear you joking? You cannot joke about these things. That's a serious allegation. I think you better leave!"
