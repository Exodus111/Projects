        "Node12": "I mean... It's not like an adult game or anything...\n\nBut it contains some pretty adult themes, \nand is not appropriate for children, \nso you know.... trigger warning and all that.",

        "Node31": "I want to tell you more, but, let's go to my room first.\nIts the door on the left there.\n\nAnd the only door that is going to work because... \nWell as I said... this is a tutorial.",

        "Node5": "Ok... This is the tutorial for the game. \nRight... tutorial... lets do this!",
        "Node6": "Ok, so you can move using the WASD keys, as you do in most games.\n\nYou can also use the movement keys... but I'm not sure why you would want to... ",
        "Node64": "Ok, so.. \nI'm an apprentice to Father Djonsicus here in the Church.",
        "Node65": "I'm new here, but this village is... \nI don't actually remember the name of the Village.. \nSorry. As I said, I'm new, I just arrived a few days ago actually.",
        "Node66": "Anyway, there is not a lot of people in the village at the moment, \nmost are away at some festival I believe. \nAnd I've mostly been doing chores and required reading.",
        "Node7": "I don't know. Maybe you like using the movement keys instead of the WASD keys.\n\nThat's up to you.. I don't... it really has nothing to do with me.\nYou can use either, its fine... really.",
        "Node8": "Ok, moving around, easy right?\n\nSecondly the rest of the game... \nSo this is an RPG, it really is.\nBut, its probably different from games you've played before.",
        "Node9": "I mean. There is no combat here, this game is about... \nyou know... dialogue... talking to people. \nThinking about what they say, and so on..."
