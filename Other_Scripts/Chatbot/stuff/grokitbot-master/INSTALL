GrokItBot depends on PyAIML, Reverend Bayes, Twisted and Python.

Download them from the following locations:

PyAIML: http://pyaiml.sourceforge.net/
Reverend Bayes: http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodReverend
Twisted: http://twistedmatrix.com/

Then install each component (usually python setup.py install) before running GrokItBot.

Note, you may run into an error in the PyAIML Kernel that looks like this:

"exceptions.IOError: [Errno 0]"

The solution is to edit the relevant Kernel.py file and add in a sleep statement where the file IO is having problems.

For me, this file was in /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages/aiml/Kernel.py and here's how it looks now:

    response = "" 
    try: 
        out = os.popen(command)
    except RuntimeError, msg: 
        if self._verboseMode:
            err = "WARNING: RuntimeError while processing \"system\" element:\n%s\n" % msg.encode(self._textEncoding, 'replace')
            sys.stderr.write(err)
        return "There was an error while computing my response.  Please inform my botmaster."
    time.sleep(0.1) # added by Duncan Gough - 10/01/09


Note the added time.sleep(0.1)
