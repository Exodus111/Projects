Revision history for the Python package RiveScript.

1.07  TBD
	- New algorithm for handling variable tags (<get>, <set>, <add>, <sub>,
	  <mult>, <div>, <bot> and <env>) that allows for iterative nesting of
	  these tags (for example, <set copy=<get orig>> will work now).
	- Fix sorting algorithm, so triggers with matching word counts will be
	  sorted by length descending.
	- stream() function can accept a multiline string instead of an array
	- Speed optimization by precompiling as many regexps as possible (what was
	  especially helpful was to precompile substitution and simple trigger
	  regexps), taking the time-to-reply for the default brain from ~0.19s down
	  to ~0.04s

1.06  Nov 25 2014
	- Change package name from python-rivescript to simply rivescript.
	- Change from the GPLv2 license to the MIT license.
	- Add compatibility with Python 3.
	- Add Unicode support for RiveScript documents.
	- Prefer the .rive extension for RS documents over the old .rs extension.
	- Track filenames and line numbers when parsing RiveScript documents.
	- Add Perl object handler example.
	- Add current_user() method accessible from inside an object macro.
	- Add unit tests.
	- Add deparse() function that dumps the active memory state of the bot.
	- Add write() method that writes the active memory state back to disk as a
	  .rive file (uses deparse()).
	- Bugfix with substitution placeholders.
	- Bugfix with the <input> and <reply> tags.

1.01  May 20 2013
	- Small bugfix in _rot13 that caused crashes under certain circumstances.
	- Small bugfix regarding the {weight} tag and atomic triggers.
	- Restructure the RiveScript library (move rivescript.py into a package
	  folder named 'rivescript', separate the interactive mode code into
	  interactive.py)

1.00  Apr 22 2012
	- Initial version of rivescript.py
